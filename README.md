# Image Wallet

## Preferences

- **Wallet Directory**: The root folder to load Cards and Pockets from.
- **Generate Video Previews**: Whether the wallet generates a preview image for videos. Makes loading the Wallet slightly slower when a video is present.
- **Remember Pocket Filter**: When re-opening the wallet, should the filtered Pocket be restored?

## Folder Structure

> The Wallet Directory can have multiple Pockets and Cards within it. Pockets can have multiple Cards, but no sub-Pockets.
