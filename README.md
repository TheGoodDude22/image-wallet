# Image Wallet

## Preferences

- **Wallet Directory**: The root folder to load Cards and Pockets from.
- **Generate Video Previews**: Whether the wallet generates a preview image for the first frame of videos. Makes loading the Wallet slightly slower when a video is present.
- **Remember Pocket Filter**: When re-opening image wallet, should the filtered Pocket be restored?

## Folder Structure
